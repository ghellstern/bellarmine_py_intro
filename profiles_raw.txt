"304737" "my daughter love family\friends people new adventures water( beach, lakes, ponds, puddles) peace oops that seven! i have a strong heart & for a guy let alone a person of my age, i have a very level head on my shoulders. i know what i want out of life & i know exactly how i am going to achieve all of that. with everything i've dealt with in my life so far & have to face & deal with now, it's forced me to grow up a lot. i'm a crazy person who is full of life, i have a lot to say about everything & anything. i'm probably the most simple, nicest, and most caring person you could ever meet in your lifetime who isn't a total doormat. i laugh a lot & smile easily & i have my flaws. i also love (in no particular order): books, red wine, random encounters, fire pits, my two fuzzy dogs (australian shepherds), baking, mexican food, jazz (miles davis, not kenny g), happy people, film photography, warm feet under the covers, the idea of serendipity, debating, painting rooms in my house, pomegranates, religion (not any one in particular, i'm fascinated equally by all), 80s movies, traveling, jogging, playing guitar, pistachio gelato, being kissed, walking to work, electric blankets, yoga in the morning, my family, pale ales with olives, eye contact, adventures, snow, grilled salmon, sushi and sports talk radio. they don't take me as seriously & think i'm just a big joke. therefore i choose who i get really close to & who i need to start backing away from. i don't get along with a lot of guys because most of them don't know the qualifications of a friend. everything happens for a reason & everything is fate when it comes to that. but anyways... don't try to impress me. be yourself. don't be fake. i hate fake people, you know the kind that go through friends like underwear & those who like to flash people with their possessions. yea it's cool that you have nice things but you don't need to be all up in my face about it. i love people who aren't afraid to be themselves, who don't care what others think & aren't afraid to bend the rules a little bit. someone who is independent & has a good idea of what they want out of life & won't sit back & wait for it to be handed to them. people who aren't afraid to grow up a little bit. i love that. you'll never know how i really feel until i tell you unless you're just one of those lucky people who well.. just knows by lookin at me. i don't hold grudges because it's a waste of time & energy. i'm ready for my life to begin & it's beginning. i have people in my life that i absolutely could not live without... and they know who they are, if they don't than i need to have a lil chat with them. soooo.. that's what i'm doing. well im gonna wrap this up...as i think i've pretty much covered everything! looking for you eating out, just saying food, football, family. a little about myself, i have had many accomplishments, but the one i take the most pride in, is that of being a good son, father & friend."
